**Description:**
In Wintergrasp there are vendors for Alliance only (when Alliance owns the base). One vendor that sells Gems and one that sells weapons.

**How to reproduce:**
Enter the base when Alliance owns it, at the stairs are two vendors - there are no similar vendors for Horde when Horde owns the base.

**How it should work:**
Both factions should have equal access to these kind of vendors.
